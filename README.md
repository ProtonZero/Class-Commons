# Class Commons #
*Class Commons* is a project to provide a common compatibility interface for class systems. The goal of this is to make libraries independent of class libraries, a library using the Class Commons API can then be used with any class system adhering to it (albeit via a compatibility layer).

## Specification ##

### Features ###
* Single-class inheritance
* Constructors
* Instance methods
* Polymorphism

Class definition is single-write read-only, so the entire class has to be defined on creation.

### Functions ###
	class common.class(name, table, parents...)

### Class constructors ###
Constructors are defined by the special `init' function:
	foo = common.class("foo", {})
	function foo:init()
		self.bar = "baz"
	end

Derived classes may access the super class constructors by using super.init, but
ONLY if the parent was created using common.class:
	foo = common.class("foo", {init = function(self) self.foo = true end})
	bar = common.class("bar", {init = function(self) foo.init(self) end})

NOTE: Accessing super.init from classes not created with common.class yields
      undefined behaviour.

#### Example ####
	local Tree = {}
	function Tree:grow()
		print("Is a big tree now!")
	end

	function Tree:chop()
		print("Chopped down a tree.")
	end

	local Ent = {}
	function Ent:chop()
		print("I am no tree, I am an ent!")
	end
	
	Tree = common.class("Tree", Tree)
	Ent = common.class("Ent", Ent, Tree)

	-- using one of the implementing class systems
	-- providing a 'new' function (fictional)
	local tree = new(Ent)
	tree:grow() --> Is a big tree now!
	tree:chop() --> I am no tree, I am an ent!

### Considerations ###
Nothing is set in stone yet, not the function name, not the function syntax, and even the features have only been determined to an extent.
Following is a list of things to be resolved:

* What is the function name going to be?
* For inheritance, do we pass the class by-value or by-name?
* Are names fixed, stored internally and enforced, or just there to satisfy underlying libraries?
* Are names left out and 'faked' by the wrapper?
* What's the name of the constructor?

## Participating libraries ##
* [SECS][]
* [Slither][]
* [MiddleClass][]
* [hump.class][]

## Repository information ##
This repository will both contain documentation (like this very document) as possible testing implementations.
The authors of participating libraries all get write access, and are free, and encouraged, to collaborate.
Perhaps it's a good idea if we provide a dumbed down reference implementation and extensive tests?
